# Domain Authority Auditor

> Based on [CITE Domain Rating](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/cite-domain-rating). Full benchmark reference: [references/cite-domain-rating.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/cite-domain-rating.md)
This skill evaluates domain authority across 40 standardized criteria organized in 4 dimensions. It produces a comprehensive audit report with per-item scoring, dimension and weighted scores by domain type, veto item checks, and a prioritized action plan.

**Sister skill**: [content-quality-auditor](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/cross-cutting/content-quality-auditor/SKILL.md) evaluates content at the page level (80 items). This skill evaluates the domain behind the content (40 items). Together they provide a complete 120-item assessment.

> **Namespace note**: CITE uses C01-C10 for Citation items; CORE-EEAT uses C01-C10 for Contextual Clarity items. In combined 120-item assessments, prefix with the framework name (e.g., CITE-C01 vs CORE-C01) to avoid confusion.

## When This Must Trigger

Use this when domain credibility or citation trustworthiness is in question — even if the user doesn't use audit terminology:

- User asks "how trustworthy is my site" or "is my domain credible"
- When backlink-analyzer finds toxic link ratio above 15%, its handoff summary recommends this gate check
- Evaluating domain authority before a GEO campaign
- Benchmarking your domain against competitors
- Assessing whether a domain is trustworthy as a citation source
- Running periodic domain health checks or after link building campaigns
- Identifying manipulation red flags (PBNs, link farms, penalty history)
- Cross-referencing with content-quality-auditor for full 120-item assessment

## What This Skill Does

1. **Full 40-Item Audit**: Scores every CITE check item as Pass/Partial/Fail
2. **Dimension Scoring**: Calculates scores for all 4 dimensions (0-100 each)
3. **Weighted Totals**: Applies domain-type-specific weights for CITE Score
4. **Critical Issue Detection**: Flags critical manipulation signals that cap the score
5. **Priority Ranking**: Identifies Top 5 improvements sorted by impact
6. **Action Plan**: Generates specific, actionable improvement steps
7. **Cross-Reference**: Optionally pairs with CORE-EEAT for combined diagnosis

## Quick Start

Start with one of these prompts. Finish with a citation-trust verdict and a handoff summary using the repository format in [Skill Contract](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/skill-contract.md).

### Audit Your Domain

```
Audit domain authority for [domain]
Run a CITE domain audit on [domain] as a [domain type]
```

### Audit with Domain Type

```
CITE audit for example.com as an e-commerce site
Score this SaaS domain against the 40-item benchmark: [domain]
```

### Comparative Audit

```
Compare domain authority: [your domain] vs [competitor 1] vs [competitor 2]
```

### Combined Assessment

```
Run full 120-item assessment on [domain]: CITE domain audit + CORE-EEAT content audit on [sample pages]
```

## Skill Contract

**Gate verdict**: **TRUSTED** (no critical issues, scores above threshold) / **CAUTIOUS** (issues found but none critical) / **UNTRUSTED** (a critical trust issue failed — see "Critical Issue to Fix" in the report). Always state the verdict prominently at the top of the report using plain language, not item IDs.

**Expected output**: a CITE audit report, a citation-trust verdict, and a short handoff summary ready for `memory/audits/domain/`.

- **Reads**: the target domain, supporting authority signals, comparison domains, and prior decisions from [CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/CLAUDE.md) and the shared [State Model](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/state-model.md) when available.
- **Writes**: a user-facing authority report plus a reusable summary that can be stored under `memory/audits/domain/`.
- **Promotes**: veto items and domain risks to `memory/hot-cache.md` (auto-saved). Authority context to `memory/audits/domain/`. Results feed into entity-optimizer as authority input for brand's canonical profile.
- **Primary next skill**: use the `Next Best Skill` below once the trust picture is clear.

## Data Sources

> See [CONNECTORS.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/CONNECTORS.md) for tool category placeholders.

> **Note:** All integrations are optional. This skill works without any API keys — users provide data manually when no tools are connected.

**With ~~link database + ~~SEO tool + ~~AI monitor + ~~knowledge graph + ~~brand monitor connected:**
Automatically pull backlink profiles and link quality metrics from ~~link database, domain authority scores and keyword rankings from ~~SEO tool, AI citation data from ~~AI monitor, entity presence from ~~knowledge graph, and brand mention data from ~~brand monitor.

**With manual data only:**
Ask the user to provide:
1. Domain to evaluate
2. Domain type (if not auto-detectable): Content Publisher, Product & Service, E-commerce, Community & UGC, Tool & Utility, or Authority & Institutional
3. Backlink data: referring domains count, domain authority, top linking domains
4. Traffic estimates (from any SEO tool or SimilarWeb)
5. Competitor domains for comparison (optional)

Proceed with the full 40-item audit using provided data. Note in the output which items could not be fully evaluated due to missing access (e.g., AI citation data, knowledge graph queries, WHOIS history).

## Instructions

When a user requests a domain authority audit:

### Step 1: Preparation

```markdown
### Audit Setup

**Domain**: [domain]
**Domain Type**: [auto-detected or user-specified]
**Dimension Weights**: [from domain-type weight table below]

#### Domain-Type Weight Table

> Canonical source: `references/cite-domain-rating.md`. This inline copy is for convenience.

| Dim | Default | Content Publisher | Product & Service | E-commerce | Community & UGC | Tool & Utility | Authority & Institutional |
|-----|:-------:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| C | 35% | **40%** | 25% | 20% | 35% | 25% | **45%** |
| I | 20% | 15% | **30%** | 20% | 10% | **30%** | 20% |
| T | 25% | 20% | 25% | **35%** | 25% | 25% | 20% |
| E | 20% | 25% | 20% | 25% | **30%** | 20% | 15% |

#### Critical Trust Check (Emergency Brake)

| Check | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Link profile matches real traffic | ✅ Pass / ⚠️ CRITICAL | [If CRITICAL: "Audit backlink profile; disavow toxic links"] |
| Backlink profile is unique to this domain | ✅ Pass / ⚠️ CRITICAL | [If CRITICAL: "Flag as manipulation network; investigate link sources"] |
| No Google penalties or deindexing | ✅ Pass / ⚠️ CRITICAL | [If CRITICAL: "Address penalty first; all other optimization is futile"] |
```

If any critical trust check triggers, flag it prominently at the top of the report using plain language. CITE Score is capped per [Runbook §2](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/auditor-runbook.md).

### Step 2: C + I Audit (20 items)

Evaluate each item against the criteria in [references/cite-domain-rating.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/cite-domain-rating.md).

Score each item:
- **Pass** = 10 points (fully meets criteria)
- **Partial** = 5 points (partially meets criteria)
- **Fail** = 0 points (does not meet criteria)

```markdown
### C — Citation

| ID | Check Item | Score | Notes |
|----|-----------|-------|-------|
| C01 | Referring Domains Volume | Pass/Partial/Fail | [specific observation] |
| C02 | Referring Domains Quality | Pass/Partial/Fail | [specific observation] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| C10 | Link Source Diversity | Pass/Partial/Fail | [specific observation] |

**C Score**: [X]/100

### I — Identity

| ID | Check Item | Score | Notes |
|----|-----------|-------|-------|
| I01 | Knowledge Graph Presence | Pass/Partial/Fail | [specific observation] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**I Score**: [X]/100
```

### Step 3: T + E Audit (20 items)

Same format for Trust and Eminence dimensions.

```markdown
### T — Trust

| ID | Check Item | Score | Notes |
|----|-----------|-------|-------|
| T01 | Link Profile Naturalness | Pass/Partial/Fail | [specific observation] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**T Score**: [X]/100

### E — Eminence

| ID | Check Item | Score | Notes |
|----|-----------|-------|-------|
| E01 | Organic Search Visibility | Pass/Partial/Fail | [specific observation] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**E Score**: [X]/100
```

**Note**: Some items require specialized data (C05-C08 AI citation data, I01 knowledge graph queries, T04-T05 IP/profile analysis). Score what is observable; mark unverifiable items as "N/A — requires [data source]" and exclude from dimension average.

## §1 · Handoff Schema (authoritative)

Every auditor-class handoff MUST follow this shape. Emitted audit artifact files (e.g., `memory/audits/**/*.md`) MUST include `class: auditor-output` in their YAML frontmatter so the PostToolUse Artifact Gate and guarded auditor archive checks can detect them by frontmatter class instead of prose pattern-matching. Files lacking this marker are not treated as audit artifacts regardless of body content.

```yaml
---
class: auditor-output            # REQUIRED frontmatter marker for emitted audit artifacts
---

status: DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_INPUT
objective: "what was audited"
key_findings:
  - title: short issue name
    severity: veto | high | medium | low
    evidence: direct quote or data point
evidence_summary: URLs / data points reviewed
open_loops: blockers or missing inputs
recommended_next_skill: primary next move

# Cap-related fields — AUDITOR-CLASS ONLY
cap_applied: true | false        # REQUIRED for auditors
raw_overall_score: <number>      # REQUIRED for auditors; score before cap
final_overall_score: <number>    # REQUIRED for auditors; score after cap
```

### Legacy compatibility for archived outputs

New auditor-class outputs MUST include the cap-related fields. The Artifact Gate treats missing `cap_applied`, `raw_overall_score`, or `final_overall_score` (unless `status: BLOCKED`) as a validation failure.

Consumers reading pre-v7.2 archived outputs may apply these defaults:

- `cap_applied: false` (assume no cap when field missing)
- `raw_overall_score: <use final_overall_score>` (treat as equal)
- `final_overall_score: <use the overall score from the audit, whatever field name>`

This compatibility rule is read-time only; it does not permit new auditor artifacts to omit required auditor-extension fields.

### Non-auditor skills

Non-auditor skill handoffs follow [skill-contract.md §Handoff Summary Format](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/skill-contract.md) as-is. Cap-related fields do not apply. Non-auditors never emit `cap_applied` / `raw_overall_score` / `final_overall_score`, and MUST NOT use the `class: auditor-output` frontmatter marker.

## §2 · Critical Fail Cap — Decision Table and Worked Examples

> **How to use this section in Step 4.5**: re-read Worked Example 1 below **before** computing your own cap. Mirror its "Before cap / Veto check / After cap / Handoff" format literally. Walk the decision table (4 rows) to identify which scenario matches your input. Count veto failures across all dimensions (not per-dimension). Apply the cap rule — it is a ceiling, not a floor.

**Rule summary**: when any veto item fails, cap the affected dimension and the overall score at **60/100**. Show raw and capped side by side in the internal report. Set `cap_applied: true` in handoff.

**Veto items**:
- CORE-EEAT: T04, C01, R10 — see [core-eeat-benchmark.md §Veto Items](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/core-eeat-benchmark.md)
- CITE: T03, T05, T09 — see [cite-domain-rating.md §Veto Items](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/cite-domain-rating.md)

### Decision table

| Scenario | Affected dimension behavior | Overall score behavior | Handoff status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0 veto fails** | no cap | no cap | `cap_applied: false` |
| **1 veto fails; raw dim > 60** | `min(raw_dim, 60)` → capped down to 60 | `min(raw_overall, 60)` | `cap_applied: true` |
| **1 veto fails; raw dim ≤ 60** | unchanged (no raise, no lower) | `min(raw_overall, 60)` | `cap_applied: true` |
| **2+ veto fails** | `status: BLOCKED`, do NOT emit capped scores | `raw_overall_score` retained for record | `cap_applied: false`, reason in `open_loops` |

**Cap target**: always the post-penalty final dimension value, never the raw pre-penalty value. If non-veto items already penalized the dimension, compute the post-penalty number first, then apply the veto cap to that.

**Rounding rule (deterministic)**: all score arithmetic uses `math.floor` (truncate decimals). `77.5 → 77`, not `78`. `59.9 → 59`, not `60`. Applies to `raw_overall_score`, `final_overall_score`, dimension scores, and all intermediate calculations. QA and regression tests can rely on this — a re-run on the same inputs always produces the same integer. Worked Example 2 demonstrates: `raw_overall = 77.5` appears as `raw_overall_score: 77` in the handoff.

### Worked example 1 — single veto, raw dim above cap (classic case)

```
Before cap:
  Dimensions: C=75 O=77 R=80 E=75 Exp=78 Ept=77 A=77 T=85
  Sum = 624; raw_overall = 624 / 8 = 78 (exact)

Veto check: T04 failed (affiliate links without disclosure)

After cap:
  T dimension: 85 → 60 (capped down because raw > 60)
  Overall: 78 → 60 (capped at 60 because any veto forces overall cap)

Handoff:
  cap_applied: true
  raw_overall_score: 78
  final_overall_score: 60
  key_findings:
    - title: "Missing affiliate disclosure"
      severity: veto
      evidence: "No disclosure banner; 3 affiliate links detected in body"
```

### Worked example 2 — single veto, raw dim already below cap

```
Before cap:
  Dimensions: C=55 O=75 R=88 E=80 Exp=80 Ept=75 A=82 T=85
  raw_overall = 77.5

Veto check: C01 failed (clickbait — title doesn't match content)

After cap:
  C dimension: 55 → 55 (unchanged; cap is a ceiling, not a floor)
  Overall: 77 → 60 (overall still capped because veto present)

Handoff:
  cap_applied: true
  raw_overall_score: 77
  final_overall_score: 60
  key_findings:
    - title: "Title promises something the page doesn't deliver"
      severity: veto
      evidence: "Title: '10 Free Tools'; body delivers 3 free tools and 7 paid"
```

**Important**: the C dimension number in the internal report stays 55. It is NOT raised to 60. The cap is a ceiling only.

### Worked example 3 — 2+ veto fails (BLOCKED path)

```
Before cap:
  Dimensions: C=75 O=77 R=80 E=75 Exp=78 Ept=77 A=77 T=85
  Sum = 624; raw_overall = 624 / 8 = 78 (exact)

Veto check: T04 AND R10 both failed

Resolution:
  status: BLOCKED
  Do NOT compute capped scores.
  raw_overall_score retained for record; final_overall_score omitted.

Handoff:
  status: BLOCKED
  cap_applied: false
  raw_overall_score: 78
  # final_overall_score intentionally omitted
  open_loops:
    - "2 veto items failed: T04 (affiliate disclosure) and R10 (data inconsistency)"
    - "Multi-veto cap calibration pending v7.3; page requires manual review before re-scoring"
  key_findings:
    - title: "Missing affiliate disclosure"
      severity: veto
      evidence: "..."
    - title: "Data points contradict each other"
      severity: veto
      evidence: "..."
```

**Why BLOCKED, not "capped at 40"**: the 40-tier cap number is unvalidated. Blocking forces manual review, which is more honest than publishing an eyeballed number. Calibration trigger:
